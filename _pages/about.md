I am currently a Senior Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, DC. I plan on attending a PhD program in Statistics starting in Fall 2018. You can find a copy of my resume [here](/files/derek_resume.pdf). As a part of my work at the Federal Reserve, I am co-authoring a paper titled "A Randomized Missing Data Approach to Missing Data with Applications to Economics and Finance" (check back for a pre-print soon). I've also written an R package, RSMC2, which facilitates Bayesian estimation of general non-linear state-space models ([Github](https://www.github.com/dereklh24/RSMC2)). I've written a [vignette](/files/stochastic_volatility.html) describing the use of this package.
